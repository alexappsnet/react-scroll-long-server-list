# Demo for different scrolling types in React

This example demonstrates:

- Scrolling with the "Load More" button.
- "Infinite scrolling" with additional "batch" loaded when the user scrolls to the bottom.
- "Scroll to any point" when the div is pre-allocated, and the missing records are loaded dynamically.
